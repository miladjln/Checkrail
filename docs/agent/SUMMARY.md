# Project Architecture Context

[SYSTEM]
- Domain: AI Coding Agent Governance & CI Quality Gate Harness
- Stack: Bash 4.4+, POSIX Shell, Python 3.12+, GitHub Actions CI
- Deployment: Local Git Pre-Commit Hooks + GitHub Actions Workflows
- Constraints: Zero secret leaks, sub-second doc synchronization, strict sandbox isolation, zero drift
- Residual risk: Local secret scan uses fallback regex if gitleaks is missing. CI must install gitleaks.

[PIPELINES]
1. Developer/Agent Edit -> Pre-Commit Quality Gate (Fast Tier) -> Staged Verification
2. Git Push / PR -> GitHub Actions Quality Gate (Doctor + Full 8-Tier Gates) -> Merged to main

[REPO CONVENTIONS]
